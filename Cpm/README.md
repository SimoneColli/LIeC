# $C^{\pm}$ language

This is a small programming language inspired by C. For a comprehensive understanding of its specifications, please refer to the [documentation](./doc/tex/main.pdf).

Currently, we are implementing the lexer using Flex.

## How to build the lexer

```bash
cd flex ; mkdir build ; cd build
cmake ..
make [test]
```
